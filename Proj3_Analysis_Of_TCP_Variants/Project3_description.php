<h2>Project 3: Performance Analysis of TCP Variants</h2>
<p>
<b>This project is due at 11:59pm on October 24, 2014.</b>
</p><p>
<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>
The original design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) worked
reliably, but was unable to provide acceptable performance
in large and congested networks. Several TCP variants have been
proposed since then (TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas, BIC, CUBIC, SACK, and others)
with mechanisms to control and avoid congestion. The objective of this
project is for you to analyze the performance of these different TCP
variants. You will use the NS-2 network simulator to perform
experiments that will help you understand the behavior of the TCP
variants under various load conditions and queuing algorithms.
</p><p>
In order to perform a complete analysis of the TCP
variants, you should first read the paper <a href="papers/tcp-sim.pdf">"Simulation-based
Comparisons of Tahoe, Reno and SACK TCP"</a>
to gain a better understanding of the type of analysis you are required to
do. The paper also includes details on the relevant TCP variants used in this
assignment.
</p><p>
The final product of this assignment is a report that describes the
results of your simulated experiments. This report will follow the
formatting of a submission to an academic workshop. Your report must
be <=6 pages long, and include an introduction, a methodology section,
sections for experimental results, and a conclusion. Basically, your
report should look like the papers we have been reading in class,
just shorter.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started With NS-2</h2>
<p>
You will find the complete NS-2 package installed on the CCIS Linux
machines in the following directory: /course/cs4700f12/ns-allinone-2.35/.
In order to run NS-2, use the following command:
</p><p><i>% /course/cs4700f12/ns-allinone-2.35/bin/ns &lt;your_program.tcl&gt;</i></p><p>
For example, download: <a href="http://nile.wpi.edu/NS/Example/ex-tcl.tcl">ex-tcl.tcl</a> and enter:
</p><p><i>% /course/cs4700f12/ns-allinone-2.35/bin/ns ex-tcl.tcl</i></p><p>
NS-2 will output:
<pre>
k < 5, pow = 1.0
k < 5, pow = 1120.0
k < 5, pow = 1254400.0
k < 5, pow = 1404928000.0
k < 5, pow = 1573519360000.0
k >= 5, mod = 0
k >= 5, mod = 4
k >= 5, mod = 0
k >= 5, mod = 0
k >= 5, mod = 4
</pre>
You can save yourself the time and trouble of typing in the full path to NS-2
by modifying the PATH variable of your shell.
</p><p>
As you can see in the above example, each NS-2 simulation is controlled by a script
file written in TCL. There are several excellent online resources that will tell you
how to write NS-2 scripts:
<ul><li><a href="http://nile.wpi.edu/NS/">NS by example</a>: An excellent tutorial with many examples</li>
<li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/tutorial/index.html">Marc Greis's 
  tutorial</a>: The most official tutorial from the NS-2 website</li>
<li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">The NS-2 Manual</a></li></ul>
</p>
<h2>Generating Graphs from NS-2 Data</h2>
<p>
In order to analyze the results of your NS-2 simulations, you should enable NS-2's trace file
by putting the following lines of code in your script:
<pre>
#Open the trace file (before you start the experiment!)
set tf [open my_experimental_output.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tf
...
# Close the trace file (after you finish the experiment!)
close $tf
</pre>
These commands will tell NS-2 to create an output file that includes traces of all the packets
sent during your experiment. You will need to write other scripts (in whatever language you choose)
that parse this data and analyze the results. Your scripts should report things like average bandwidth,
packet drops, throughput over time, end-to-end latency (average and over time), sequence numbers of
packets sent, and the congestion window of all TCP flows. This information will enable you to analyze
the results of your experiments and answer the questions below. You need to understand the format 
of NS-2s trace file in order to successfully write these scripts.
</p><p>
My suggestion would be to write simple Python
scripts to parse/analyze the trace (e.g. compute the average throughput of each flow), output the
results to a file, and then use gnuplot or Excel to plot graphs of the data.
</p><p>
Note that many of the NS-2 tutorials refer to tools like nam and xgraph that come bundled with NS-2.
I have never used these tools, and I do not recommend that you use them. However, these tools are\
installed in the NS-2 directory and you may use
them if you wish. Do not ask for technical support about these tools, because we cannot help you!
</p><p>
<h2>Experiment 1: TCP Performance Under Congestion</h2>
In the first set of experiments, you will analyze the performance of TCP
variants (Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and Vegas) under the influence of
various load conditions. 
To study the behavior of the four TCP variants, you need to first set
up a network topology. Use the following topology for your experiments,
and set the bandwidth of each link to 10Mbps:
<pre>
                         N1                      N4
                           \                    /
                            \                  /
                             N2--------------N3
                            /                  \
                           /                    \
                         N5                      N6
</pre>
Using this topology, you will perform tests that analyze the performance
of different TCP variants in the presence of a Constant Bit Rate (CBR)
flow. You can think of the CBR flow as an unresponsive UDP flow: it uses
a specific amount of bandwidth, it does not care about dropped packets,
and it does not perform congestion control. Basically, it just sends packets blindly
at a constant rate. 
</p><p>
Add a CBR source at N2 and a sink at N3, then add a single TCP stream
from N1 to a sink at N4. Analyze the throughput, packet drop rate, and
latency of the TCP stream as a function of the bandwidth used by the CBR flow.
That is, the bandwidth of the CBR flow is the parameter
you need to vary for this experiment.
For example, start the CBR flow at a rate of 1 Mbps and record the performance
of the TCP flow. Then change the CBR flow's rate to 2 Mbps and perform the
test again. Keep changing the CBR's rate until it reaches the bottleneck capacity.
The TCP stream's performance will change depending on the amount of contention 
with the CBR flow. Conduct this experiment using the
following TCP variants: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and Vegas.
</p><p>
Based on the results from your tests you should be able to answer the following
questions: which TCP variant(s) are able to get higher average throughput? Which
has the lowest average latency? Which has the fewest drops? Is there an overall
"best" TCP variant in this experiment, or does the "best" variant vary depending
on other circumstances?
</p><p>
<h2>Experiment 2: Fairness Between TCP Variants</h2>
Next, you will conduct experiments to analyze the fairness between different
TCP variants. Out on the Internet, there are many different operating systems,
each of which may use a different variant of TCP. Ideally, all of these variants
should be fair to one another, i.e. no particular variant gets more bandwidth
than the others. However, is this ideal assumption actually true?
</p><p>
For these experiments, you will start three flows: one CBR, and two
TCP. Add a CBR source at N2 and a sink at N3, then add two TCP streams from
N1 to N4 and N5 to N6, respectively. As in Experiment 1, plot the average
throughput, packet loss rate, and latency of each TCP flow as a function of the
bandwidth used by the CBR flow. Repeat the experiments using the following
pairs of TCP variants (i.e. with one flow from N1 to N4, and the other flow
from N5 to N6):
<ul>
  <li>Reno/Reno </li>
  <li>NewReno/Reno</li>
  <li>Vegas/Vegas</li> 
  <li>NewReno/Vegas</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Based on your results you should be able to answer the following questions:
are the different combinations of variants fair to each other? Are there combinations
that are unfair, and if so, why is the combination unfair? To explain unfairness,
you will need to think critically about how the protocols are implemented and why
the different choices in different TCP variants can impact fairness.
</p><p>
<h2>Experiment 3: Influence of Queuing</h2>
Queuing disciplines like DropTail and Random Early Drop (RED) are
algorithms that control how packets in a queue are treated. In these experiments,
instead of varying the rate of the CBR flow, you will study the influence of
the queuing discipline used by nodes on the overall throughput of flows.
</p><p>
Use the same topology from experiment 1 and have one TCP flow (N1-N4) and
one CBR/UDP (N5-N6) flow.
First, start the TCP flow. Once the TCP flow is steady, start the CBR
source and analyze how the TCP and CBR flows change under the following
queuing algorithms: DropTail and RED. Perform the experiments with TCP
Reno and SACK. In these tests, you will need to plot the performance of
the TCP and CBR flow over time (i.e. you are no longer varying the bandwidth
of the CBR flow).
</p><p>
Based on the results of these experiments, you should be able to answer the
following questions:
<ul><li>Does each queuing discipline provide fair bandwidth to each flow?</li>
<li>How does the end-to-end latency for the flows differ between DropTail and RED?</li>
<li>How does the TCP flow react to the creation of the CBR flow?</li>
<li>Is RED a good idea while dealing with SACK?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
Your report will be graded as if it were a paper submission to a workshop. Basically, if your paper is
clear and concise, your methodology is sound and carefully explained, and your results are clearly
presented and thoughtfully analyzed, then your report is "accepted" and you get a perfect score.
The reviewers (graders) will score papers using the following guidelines:
<ul><li><b>Intro:</b> 5% of your grade. Your intro should explain what it is that you are studying and
motivate why this is an important problem to study. Good introductions also include a "preview" that
highlights the major experiments you will be presenting, and some of your key results.</li>
<li><b>Methodology:</b> 10% of your grade. The methodology section should clearly explain how your
experiments were conducted. What tools were used? Why did you choose to use these tools, and how do
you know they are sound? What were the key parameters/variables/settings
used during the experiments? Why did you choose these values?</li>
<li><b>Results for Experiment 1:</b> 30% of your grade. Present and thoroughly analyze the results
from the first set of experiments. Explain why the results are the way they are by discussing how
the different TCP variants react to the presence of congestion. Does each variant behave the same way,
and if not, why not? 
<li><b>Results for Experiment 2:</b> 30% of your grade. Thoroughly and carefully present the
results from the two-TCP stream experiments. When there are two TCP streams, do they share bandwidth
fairly, and if not, why not?
If there are any unexpected or "shocking" findings, highlight them in your text and discuss what leads
to these results.</li>
<li><b>Results for Experiment 3:</b> 20% of your grade. Use the same guidelines as for the first
two experimental sections. Discuss the impact of different queuing techniques on each TCP variant. Why
does each TCP variant react the way it does to different types of queues? Do specific combinations
of TCP variants and queues work well together? Are there other combinations that should not be
used together?</li>
<li><b>Conclusion:</b> 5% of your grade. Restate the significance of your study and highlight key results.
Discuss the real-world significance of your results, and what the implications may be on deployed systems.
Highlight any open questions that may motivate future studies.</li>
</ul>
Your report must be <=6 pages in length. Points will be subtracted for reports that are too long.
</p><p>
Just like any other writing assignment, you may (and are encouraged) to cite related work. You do not
need to cite sources when discussing the implementation details of TCP or queue variants (it's safe to
assume that
the inner workings of protocols are common knowledge). However, it may be useful to cite other studies
that confirm your results or use similar methodology, in order to bolster your claims.
</p><p>
<h2>Tips for Paper Writing</h2>
Writing scientific papers is a challenging endeavor. Here are a few tips for polishing your paper.
<ul>
<li>Published papers are typically in font size 10.</li>
<li>If you look at the papers you've been reading for homework, you'll notice that they use small
graphs, usually with several graphs in a row. This is an excellent space saving technique.</li>
<li>The 6 page limit means that you will not be able to include graphs/plots/tables of all your
experimental results in your report. Do not attempt to cram all your
results into a small number of graphs: papers get rejected all the time for having difficult to read graphs!
Instead, you must pick and choose which result graphs to include in your report.</li>
<li><b>Always put labels on the x- and y-axis of your graphs.</b> If we can't interpret your graphs,
then you will not receive credit for them.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h2>Submitting Your Project</h2>
Before turning in your project, you and your partner(s) must register your group. To register yourself
in a group, execute the following script:
<pre>$ /course/cs5700f14/bin/register project3 [team name]</pre>
This will either report back success or will give you an error message.  If you have trouble registering,
please contact the course staff. <b>You and your partner(s) must all run this script with the same
[team name]</b>. This is how we know you are part of the same group.
</p><p>
To turn-in your project, you should <b>submit your report as a pdf file</b>. In addition to your report,
you must turn-in your NS-2 TCL scripts, as well as any custom scripts you write to parse NS-2 trace files.
Your report, source code, etc. should all be placed in a directory. You submit
your project by running the turn-in script as follows:
<pre>$ /course/cs5700f14/bin/turnin project3 [project directory]</pre>
[project directory] is the name of the directory with your submission. The script will print out every
file that you are submitting, so make sure that it prints out all of the files you wish to submit!
The turn-in script will not accept submissions that are missing a README file. 
<b>Only one group member needs to submit your project.</b> Your group may submit as many times as you
wish; only the last submission will be graded, and the time of the last submission will determine
whether your assignment is late.
</p><p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
This project is worth 12 points. You will receive credit based on the above guidelines for your report.
</p><p>
<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
There is extra credit available for this assignment. However, I will warn you in advance that this
extra credit will be quite challenging (and possibly very annoying). Basically, the number of TCP variants
support by NS-2 is very limited. If you implement another TCP variant (i.e. BIC, CUBIC, Hybla, Compound) in NS-2
and add it to the tests in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, you will earn 1 point of extra credit. Each additional
variant that you incorporate into your report will earn you an additional bonus point. You may increase
the page limit of your report by 0.5 pages for each additional variant you include.
</p><p>
Implementing new protocols in NS-2 is tricky. You will need to create a local installation of NS-2 and modify
it's source code (it is written in C/C++). You will need to carefully vet your implementation to make sure
that it is performing as expected for that particular TCP variant. There are tutorials and various hacky
patches online that can show you how to modify NS-2. However, as someone who has modified NS-2 in the past,
I can tell you that it is non-trivial. If you want to do the extra credit, you are on your own.
</p><p>
The list of possible TCP variants is not strictly limited to the ones I have listed here. If you find
a different variant you would like to try and tackle, send me an email and I will approve it for you.
